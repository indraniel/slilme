This game has four external dependencies: OpusFile, Portaudio, OpenGL ES 2 and GLFW3.
These can be installed on debian-based systems with this command:

    apt install libopusfile-dev portaudio19-dev libgles2-mesa-dev libglfw3-dev

To build this game you also need CHICKEN 5, which can be downloaded here:
https://code.call-cc.org/dev-snapshots/2018/10/08/chicken-5.0.0rc3.tar.gz

untar it and build it with this command:
(replace PLATFORM=linux with PLATFORM=bsd or PLATFORM=macosx depending on your actual platform)

    make PLATFORM=linux PREFIX=/tmp/chicken-5-build install

This will install CHICKEN 5 in /tmp/chicken-5-build, you then have to set your PATH so that it is found by the rest of the system:

    export PATH=/tmp/chicken-5-build:$PATH

Then you can build the game by running the build.sh script.

    ./build.sh

And run it:

    ./main
